Dear Recruiting Manager,

\vspace*{1\baselineskip}

I am writing to apply for the position of Analyst, New Customer Marketing, Group Analytics in Stockholm or Oslo.
I am a PhD candidate at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden, and the expecting dissertation will be in September 2014. 
I believe that my knowledge on mathematics, programming skills and finance would make me a 
valuable asset in your company. Moreover, I have more than 4 years team-working experience in scientific software development.

\vspace*{1\baselineskip}

My interest about the mathematics and finance starts from my bachelor. My bachelor is in the major of
information and computational science (computational mathematics), I have learnt not only different computational methods but also the programming skills like C language and data structure.
One of the application for the mathematics is finance, I really enjoy how to take the mathematics knowledge into the field of finance. During 
my master, I simulated the process of continuous casting using ANSYS base on finite element method (FEM). While I helped one PhD student debug his own code based on FEM. 

\vspace*{1\baselineskip}

Regarding my experience in software development, actually I am involved in the development of the \textquotedblleft Exciting code \textquotedblright \ as an international developer (http://exciting-code.org/current-developers) since 2009, therefore, I have been programming over 4 years using Fortran. The main work is to
improve the existing numerical algorithms and make the software more efficient and accurate, which requires that I have solid knowledge on mathematics, physics and programming skills.
I also perform some calculations in semiconductor, and Matlab, Bash script and Python are used to process the data from my calculations. 
I have basic Java programming knowledge as well. The best fortune I have obtained from my previous study and research experience is the ability of fast learning.

\vspace*{1\baselineskip}

 I am the PhD representative at my division at KTH and was class president when
I was an undergraduate. Therefore, I truly know the value of team work. In my spare time I enjoy travelling, skiing and making new friends.

\vspace*{1\baselineskip}

I look forward to meeting with you for an interview.

\vspace*{2\baselineskip}

Best Regards,
